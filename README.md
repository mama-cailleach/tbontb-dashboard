# tbontb-dashboard

This repository contains the Streamlit dashboard for the "Two Bats or Not To Bat" (TBONTB) cricket team stats project.

## What is this?

A work-in-progress web app to explore and visualize TBONTB cricket data (2013â€“2025) interactively. The dashboard lets you view team results, player stats, venue records, and more, with filtering and charts.

## How does it work?

- **Built with:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (Python), using pandas for data and plotly for charts.
- **Main file:** `app.py` (run this to launch the dashboard).
- **Data:** CSV files for matches, players, venues, batting, and bowling stats.
- **Navigation:** Use the sidebar to switch between Home, Matches, Players, Venues, and About pages.
- **Filtering:** Each page has filters for seasons, venues, player names, etc.
- **Deployment:** The app is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud and updates automatically from this GitHub repo.
